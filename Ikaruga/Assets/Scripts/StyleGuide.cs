// StyleGuide
//              The first line of the program description will always be tabbed in 5 times (or
//          starting at Ch: 17). Subsequent lines start at Ch 13. The title will not surpass
//          Ch 100. This description describes what the code is for and a general overview
//          of how it accomplishes said task.
//
//          Note: This is a note that adds extra information to the program description.
//
//          Credits: This is where a small excerpt on where code was found can be documented
//          by a simple link, https://github.com/Diyar-Yasin
//          
//          UNDER CONSTRUCTION: This is to indicate that a feature is planned or in the process
//          of being built.
